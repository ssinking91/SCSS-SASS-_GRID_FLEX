  <h1>SCSS @import rule</h1>
  <p>
    Sass imports have the same syntax as CSS imports, except that they allow multiple imports to be separated by commas rather than requiring each one to have its own @import. Also, in the indented syntax, imported URLs aren’t required to have quotes.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      @import makes all variables, mixins, and functions globally accessible. This makes it very difficult for people (or tools) to tell where anything is defined.
    </li>
    <li>
      Because everything’s global, libraries must prefix to all their members to avoid naming collisions.
    </li>
    <li>
      @extend rules are also global, which makes it difficult to predict which style rules will be extended.
    </li>
  </ul>
